NODE JS + Electron + Python 
Package warlock

Proof of concept to replace some of the stuff the package wizard is doing.  Namely getting source files from sourcegear, building installer.  Currently Coding References takes 4-5 hours to build. Warlock will complete in 4-5. No magic, just efficient.  Need to add a lot of validation (including to login) build up the results section beyond just 1 line of info. Maybe split python functions into multiple scripts so I can update the status in javascript more often.  Python-shell does not run asynchronously today unfortunately.
